The idea of enclosure is quickly gaining attention as a discipline in Mathematics, with
its first appearance due to Sunaga (1958), it is necessary to achieve a thorough understanding
of the basic idea behind interval arithmetic and of how functions behave when
applied on intervals. We discuss the solution of the system of polynomial inclusions
using the Krawczyk method. An algorithm for computer simulation is also discussed.
